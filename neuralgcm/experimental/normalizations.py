  """Streaming normalization module.

  Normalizes input values along the feature axes using streaming estimate of
  mean and variance. This type of normalization is helpful as an initialization
  step during which the statistics of the input distribution is collected.
  Arguments `feature_shape` and `feature_axes` control which entries in the
  inputs are interpreted as samples. The streaming mean and variance is computed
  using parallel online algorithm [1]. At initialization time, the estimates are
  set to zero. To avoid division by zero, a small epsilon is added to the
  variance, similar to batch normalization. If no statistics has been collected,
  the inputs are returned unchanged.
